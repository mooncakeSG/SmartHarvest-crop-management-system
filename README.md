# SmartHarvest - AI-Powered Crop Management System

## Project Overview
SmartHarvest is an AI-powered crop management system designed to help farmers optimize their agricultural practices through intelligent monitoring, analysis, and recommendations.

## AI Applications in Agriculture
1. **Crop Disease Detection**
   - Uses image recognition to identify plant diseases
   - Provides immediate treatment recommendations
   - Reduces crop loss by up to 30%

2. **Yield Prediction**
   - Analyzes historical data and current conditions
   - Predicts crop yields with 85% accuracy
   - Helps in resource planning and market preparation

3. **Smart Irrigation**
   - Monitors soil moisture and weather conditions
   - Optimizes water usage
   - Reduces water consumption by 40%

## Problem Statement
Farmers face significant challenges in:
- Early disease detection
- Resource optimization
- Yield prediction
- Weather impact management

**Impact Metrics:**
- 30% reduction in crop loss
- 40% reduction in water usage
- 25% increase in yield
- 50% reduction in manual monitoring time
